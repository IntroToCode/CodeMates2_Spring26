# Turkish Menemen

## Menemen is a traditional Turkish breakfast of soft scrambled eggs cooked gently in a saucy mix of tomatoes and peppers, often served right in the pan with bread for scooping. It’s a staple of Turkish breakfast spreads from Istanbul to Izmir and is sometimes compared to shakshuka, but the eggs are usually more softly scrambled into the sauce.

### Steps for preparation:

1. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion and cook until soft and translucent, about 3–4 minutes.
2. Add chopped green pepper and cook until softened, 3–5 minutes.
3. Stir in garlic, cook 30 seconds, then add tomato paste (if using) and cook 1 minute to deepen the flavor.
4. Add chopped tomatoes, paprika, chili flakes, salt, and pepper. Simmer 5–7 minutes until tomatoes break down and become saucy.
5. Reduce heat to low. Crack eggs directly into the pan and gently stir once or twice to lightly scramble them into the sauce; cook until just set but still soft and slightly runny, 2–4 minutes.
6. Sprinkle with crumbled cheese (if using) and chopped parsley. Serve immediately in the pan with bread for scooping.
