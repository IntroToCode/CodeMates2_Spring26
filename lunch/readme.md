### Steps for preparation:
<!-- Each step should be a complete action. Assume the reader has never made this before. -->
1. Heat a large pot of water to boiling, and cook pasta until al dente.
2. Strain and rinse with cold water.
3. In a large bowl, combine the pasta, pesto, and spinach, and stir until evenly mixed (some spinach will wilt, some will stay firm — this is a nice contrast of textures).
4. Stir in the edamame.
5. Squeeze the lemon all over the finished dish.
6. Reserve a few lemon slices for people to add more if they like.
7. On a low heat, toast crushed almonds until just fragrant. Garnish pasta with the toasted almonds.
