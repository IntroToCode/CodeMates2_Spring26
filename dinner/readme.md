### Ingredients:
- [ ] 2 cups cooked rice (preferably day-old and refrigerated)
- [ ] 2 eggs, beaten
- [ ] 2 tablespoons neutral oil (vegetable, canola, or avocado oil)
- [ ] 2 cloves garlic, minced
- [ ] 2 green onions, chopped (separate white and green parts)
- [ ] ½ cup frozen peas and carrots (optional)
- [ ] 1–2 tablespoons soy sauce
- [ ] ½ teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)
- [ ] ¼ teaspoon white pepper or black pepper
- [ ] ½ teaspoon sesame oil (optional)

### Steps for preparation:

1. Break up the cold rice with your hands or a fork so there are no clumps. This helps the rice fry evenly and stay fluffy.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large pan or wok over medium-high heat. Pour in the beaten eggs and scramble gently until just cooked. Remove the eggs from the pan and set aside.
3. Add the remaining oil to the same pan. Add minced garlic and the white parts of the green onions. Stir-fry for about 30 seconds until fragrant.
4. Add the peas and carrots (if using) and cook for 1–2 minutes until heated through.
5. Add the rice to the pan. Use a spatula to break apart any remaining clumps and stir-fry for 2–3 minutes until the rice is hot and slightly dry.
6. Add soy sauce, salt, and pepper. Stir well so the rice is evenly seasoned.
7. Return the scrambled eggs to the pan. Add the green onion tops and sesame oil. Stir everything together and cook for another 30–60 seconds.
8. Remove from heat and serve immediately while hot.

### Notes:

- Day-old rice works best because it is drier and prevents mushy fried rice.
- Use medium-high heat to create better flavor and texture.
- You can add protein such as shrimp, chicken, ham, or tofu to make it a fuller dinner.
- Avoid adding too much soy sauce, as it can make the rice soggy.
- Pairing this dish with orange juice can really complement the savory reciepe.
